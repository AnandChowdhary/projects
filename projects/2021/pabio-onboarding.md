On the Pabio website, we designed a new onboarding flow to help users get started with the service and better qualify leads.

The flow starts with a style quiz, which asks users to select their preferred interior design styles from a set of images. The quiz is followed by a short form to collect contact information and a few more questions about the user's needs.

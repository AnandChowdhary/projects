After a customer completes the [onboarding flow](/projects/2021/pabio-onboarding) and has as interior design consulting call, we generate a personalized proposal for them. The proposal includes a list of furniture items, a a 3D photorealistic rendering of their furnished apartment, and a price breakdown.

The customer logs in to their account on Pabio.com to view their proposal. From their dashboard, they can also manage deliveries, view and pay invoices, claim insurance, and more.

These renders are interactive, so customers can click on any item to see more details about the product, including the price, description, and dimensions.

We show a 3D floor plan of the apartment, so customers can see where each item will be placed, along with a list of all the items in the proposal.

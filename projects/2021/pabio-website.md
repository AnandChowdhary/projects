In May 2021, my team and I rebranded from Koj to Pabio. As part of this, we designed new branding along with a new marketing website with our friends at Cleverclip.

We noticed that some customers only wanted to furnish a part of their homes, so we added a "Shop by room" feature to the homepage. This allows customers to select a room and get started with furnishing it right away.

To help customers understand the value of Pabio, we added a "Compare and save" section to the pricing page. This helps them compare the value of Pabio to buying furniture from traditional retailers.

We also featured stories of our customers on the case studies page.

I'm particularly proud of the humble footer, which is information-dense but easy to navigate, with contact information, links, social media, and a locale switcher. Our system automatically detects the user's country and preferred language (we serve Switzerland and Germany in English, German, or French), but we made it easy to switch to another locale if needed.

We also created landing pages for specific use cases, such as for furnishing rental apartments or offices.

Our new blog was launched with a "Koj is now Pabio" post, which we used to announce the rebranding to our current customers.

The team at Cleverclip designed custom illustrations for the website and we also used custom photography for several components.

# Oswald Labs

In 2016, I co-founded Oswald Labs, an award-winning accessibility technology company that builds products for people with disabilities, after winning the Code4Impact challenge at AngelHack Delhi.

[Nishant Gadihoke](https://nishantgadihoke.com) and I built a browser extension to help people with dyslexia read more easily on the web at AngelHack Delhi 2016 and asked Mahendra Singh Raghuwanshi to join us as a co-founder. Mahendra and I previously worked together on his ecommerce company while later became [Melangebox](https://anandchowdhary.com/projects/2017/melangebox).

At Oswald Labs, we built the world's first end-to-end web accessibility platform (A11Y.co), including daily accessibility audits with remediation (Dai11y) along with a plugin to add customization and support features (Agastya). We also built Shravan, a smartphone operating system for people with disabilities with built-in screen reader, magnifier, speech and vibrational interface, and other accessibility features, and the Augmenta11y app to help students with dyslexia read textbooks and other documents with ease.

Thousands of people use our products every day, and we worked with a variety of companies and organizations, including the Government of India's Startup India program. In 2018, we were featured in the Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia list for our work in accessibility. We also won Startup India Rocks 2016 a pool of 1,000+ startups nationwide and started Oswald Labs Accelerator, an equity-free support program for early-stage startups across Eurasia.

In 2020, I stopped working on Oswald Labs and co-founded [Pabio](https://anandchowdhary.com/projects/tags/pabio), a company that offers personalized interior design and rent-to-own furniture in Europe.

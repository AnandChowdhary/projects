# Pabio

In 2020, I co-founded Pabio with [Carlo Badini](https://carlobadini.com). With Pabio, you can get your apartment fully furnished by a professional interior designer and rent high-quality furniture on a monthly subscription.

We raised $3.5 million in pre-seed and seed from wonderful investors, including Y Combinator, session.vc, Serpentine Ventures (Swiss Ventures Group), Pioneer Fund, DD Venture Capital, and others. The service is available in Switzerland and Germany.

As co-founder and CTO, I was responsible for the product. I single-handedly built the first version of the product, and led the design and development as we hired our first engineers. As early-stage startups do, I also did a lot of other things, including design, hiring, fundraising, strategy, and operations, alongside Carlo.
